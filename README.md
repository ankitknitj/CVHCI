The advancements in computer technology have brought massive changes around the world. It has redefined the mundane tasks performed in our day-to-day life into simpler solutions. One such field that has contributed massively and growing rapidly in the modern world is Computer Vision (CV). Our
work is based on the interaction and communication of computers with humans. One such application could be applied in the medical field. People suffering from paralysis or locked-in syndrome (LIS) find it very difficult to communicate with
the world. The degradation of motor neurons in a human being result in their muscle weakening which eventually results in paralysis that restricts people to
perform voluntary actions. To communicate with such people, techniques such as brain wave, Electro Oculography (EOG), ElectroEncephaloGram (EEG), etc.
were used which were highly uncomfortable and less efficient. We have presented a video-oculography (VOG) based model that automates the task of communicating with the paralyzed patients by reading their facial landmarks, eyes
movement and transforming them into textual communication. We have used haar cascade classifier for face and eye detection and then we have distinguished between voluntary and involuntary blinks through which the user can communicate. We have also tested this modelâ€™s performance based on the distance between the user and the system. The aim is not only to provide accessible technology but also help such people to achieve independence that could be morally
uplifting as well.
